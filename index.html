                <p> Kakashi Hatake is a major character of the Naruto franchise and the leader of Team 7 later known as Team Kakashi. He later returns as one of the main supporting characters in the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime/manga series. He is a Jonin who has lived a long while and has gained lots of experience with Jutsus and combat.

                    He is one of the strongest shinobi in the Hidden Leaf Village and can use a wide variety of Jutsu. Such Jutsus that he has are Lightning Blade, Kamui, Fire Style Jutsu which he gains due to his Sharingan and many others. He is the biggest fan of Jiraiya's "Icha Icha" novel. After Kaguya's defeat, the Fifth Hokage Tsunade retired and Kakashi succeeded her as the Sixth Hokage before Naruto. </p>

                <p> Kakashi's most distinguishing ability was the Sharingan in his left eye-socket that was given to him by Obito Uchiha. Since the eye got transplanted into him, Kakashi's ability to copy nearly any technique used against him gave him the moniker Copy Ninja Kakashi (コピー忍者のカカシ, Kopī Ninja no Kakashi) while utilising many of the Sharingan abilities including genjutsu, seeing through deception, and predicting his opponent's next move. This eye also gave Kakashi a heightened visual perception to his surroundings, enabling him to perfect his Chidori and its later version, the Lightning Cutter. While fighting Obito, a potent genjutsu user, Kakashi was able to go toe to toe with his enemy in an illusionary fight until he himself asked that genjutsu fighting be abandoned due to the constant stalemates of it. </p>

                <h2 class="uppercase"> SQUAD - 7 </h2>
    
                <p>Team 7 was a Konohagakure team formed under the leadership of Kakashi Hatake. Two-and-a-half years after Sasuke Uchiha left the village, Kakashi filled out paperwork to form Team Kakashi, with his former pupils Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno now being treated as equals alongside their teacher. Following Yamato and Sai joining the team, the group went by Team Yamato during the former's leadership. Squad 7 members trained to be a Genin by Kakashi - </p>
    
                <ol>
                    <li> Sasuke Uchiha </li>
                    <li> Naruto Uzumaki </li>
                    <li> Sakura Haruno </li>
                </ol>
    
                <p> Kakashi is also a master of disguise. He occasionally disguises himself as a reporter name Sukea to secretly spy on genin and students to learn about them or pull pranks on them. The disguise involves a wig, contacts, face markings to hide his scar and an altered voice. </p>
